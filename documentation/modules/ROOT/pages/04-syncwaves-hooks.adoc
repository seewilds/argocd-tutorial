= SyncWaves and Hooks
include::_attributes.adoc[]

https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/user-guide/sync-waves/[Syncwaves,window='_blank'] are used in Argo CD to order how manifests are applied to the cluster. 

On the other hand https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/user-guide/resource_hooks/[resource hooks,window='_blank'] breaks up the delivery of these manifests in different phases.

Using a combination of syncwaves and resource hooks, you can control how your application rolls out.

This example will take you through the following steps:

* Using Syncwaves to order deployment
* Exploring Resource Hooks
* Using Syncwaves and Hooks together

The sample application that we will deploy is a TODO application with a database and apart from deployment files, syncwaves and resource hooks are used:

[#using_syncwaves]
== Using Sync Waves

A Syncwave is a way to order how Argo CD applies the manifests that are stored in git. All manifests have a wave of zero by default, but you can set these by using the `argocd.argoproj.io/sync-wave` annotation. 

Example:

[.console-input]
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
metadata:
  annotations:
    argocd.argoproj.io/sync-wave: "2"
----

The wave can also be negative as well.

[.console-input]
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
metadata:
  annotations:
    argocd.argoproj.io/sync-wave: "-5"
----

When Argo CD starts a sync action, the manifest get placed in the following order:

* The Phase that they're in (we'll cover phases in the next section)
* The wave the resource is annotated in (starting from the lowest value to the highest)
* By kind (Namespaces first, then services, then deployments, etc ...)
* By name (ascending order)

Read more about syncwaves on the https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/user-guide/sync-waves/#how-do-i-configure-waves[official documentation site,window='_blank'].

Argo CD will apply the Namespace first (since it's the lowest value), and make sure it returns a "healthy" status before moving on.

Next, the PostgreSQL Deployment will be applied. After that reports healthy will continue with the rest of resources.

NOTE: Argo CD won't apply the next manifest until the previous reports "healthy".

[#exploring_resource_hooks]
== Exploring Resource Hooks

Now that you're familiar with syncwaves, we can begin exploring applying
manifests in phases using `resource hooks`.

Controlling your sync operation can be further redefined by using
hooks. These hooks can run before, during, and after a sync
operation. These hooks are:

* **PreSync** - Runs before the sync operation. This can be something like a database backup before a schema change
* **Sync** - Runs after `PreSync` has successfully ran. This will run alongside your normal manifests.
* **PostSync** - Runs after `Sync` has ran successfully. This can be something like a Slack message or an email notification.
* **SyncFail** - Runs if the `Sync` operation as failed. This is also used to send notifications or do other evasive actions.

To enable a sync, annotate the specific object manifest with
`argocd.argoproj.io/hook` with the type of sync you want to use for that
resource. For example, if I wanted to use the `PreSync` hook:

[.console-input]
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
metadata:
  annotations:
    argocd.argoproj.io/hook: PreSync
----

You can also have the hooks be deleted after a successful/unsuccessful run.

* **HookSucceeded** - The resource will be deleted after it has succeeded.
* **HookFailed** - The resource will be deleted if it has failed.
* **BeforeHookCreation** - The resource will be deleted before a new one is created (when a new sync is triggered).

You can apply these with the `argocd.argoproj.io/hook-delete-policy`
annotation. For example

[.console-input]
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
metadata:
  annotations:
    argocd.argoproj.io/hook: PostSync
    argocd.argoproj.io/hook-delete-policy: HookSucceeded
----

IMPORTANT: Since a sync can fail in any phase, you can come to a situation where the application never reports healthy!

Although hooks can be any resource, they are usually Pods and/or Jobs.

To read more about resource hooks, consult the https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/user-guide/resource_hooks[official documentation]

[#exploring_the_manifests_hooks]
=== Exploring Manifests

Take a look at this `PostSync` manifest which sends an HTTP request to insert a new TODO item:

.link:https://github.com/redhat-developer-demos/openshift-gitops-examples/blob/main/apps/todo/todo-insert-data.yaml[todo-insert-data.yaml,window='_blank']
[source,yaml,subs="+macros,attributes+"]
----
include::ROOT:example$todo-yaml/todo-insert-data.yaml[]
----
<1> This means that this Job will run in the `PostSync` phase, after the application of the manifests in the `Sync` phase.

IMPORTANT: Since I don't have a deletion policy, this job will "stick around" after completion.

The execution order can be seen in the following diagram:

[#deploying_the_application_hooks]
=== Deploying The Application

You can see all deployment files by https://github.com/redhat-developer-demos/openshift-gitops-examples/tree/main/apps/todo[visiting the repo,window='_blank'].

Taking a look at this manifest file: `todo-application.yaml`:

[tabs, subs="attributes+,+macros"]
====
Minikube::
+
--
.link:https://github.com/redhat-scholars/argocd-tutorial/blob/master/documentation/modules/ROOT/examples/minikube/todo-yaml/todo-application.yaml[todo-application.yaml,window='_blank']
[source,yaml,subs="+macros,attributes+"]
----
include::ROOT:example$minikube/todo-yaml/todo-application.yaml[]
----

It will show that this will deploy the application in the `todo`
namespace.

Create this application:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
kubectl apply -f documentation/modules/ROOT/examples/minikube/todo-yaml/todo-application.yaml 
----

----
include::ROOT:example$todo-yaml/todo-application.yaml[]
----

It will show that this will deploy the application in the `todo`
namespace.

Create this application:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
kubectl apply -f documentation/modules/ROOT/examples/todo-yaml/todo-application.yaml 
----
--
====

[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
application.argoproj.io/todo-app created
----

On the Argo CD WebUI, you should see another application appear.

image::todo-card.png[TODO Card]

Clicking on this "card" should take you over to the tree view.

image::todo-argocd.png[TODO Tree]

Observe the sync process. You will see the order that the resource has been applied, first the namespace creation and last the creation of Route to access the application.

Once the application is fully synced. Take a look at the pods and jobs in
the namespace:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
kubectl get pods -n todo
----

You should see that the Job is finished, but still there.

[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
NAME                           READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
postgresql-599467fd86-cgj9v    1/1     Running     0          32s
todo-gitops-679d88f6f4-v4djp   1/1     Running     0          19s
todo-table-xhddk               0/1     Completed   0          27s
----

Your application should look like this.

The `todo-insert` Job is not shown as it was configured to be deleted if succeeded:
